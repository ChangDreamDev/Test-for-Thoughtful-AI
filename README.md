# ðŸ“¦ Package Sorting Robot â€“ Thoughtful Robotics

This project contains a simple Node.js function used by a robotic arm to sort packages based on their **volume**, **dimensions**, and **mass**. The sorting logic follows a set of predefined rules to dispatch packages into appropriate stacks.

---

## âœ… Objective

Sort incoming packages into one of three categories:

- **STANDARD**: Package is neither bulky nor heavy.
- **SPECIAL**: Package is bulky **or** heavy.
- **REJECTED**: Package is **both** bulky and heavy.

---

## ðŸ§® Sorting Rules

### A package is considered:

- **Bulky** if:
  - Its **volume** (Width Ã— Height Ã— Length) is **â‰¥ 1,000,000 cmÂ³**, or
  - **Any single dimension** is **â‰¥ 150 cm**

- **Heavy** if:
  - Its **mass** is **â‰¥ 20 kg**
